              The Ecosystem Services Valuation Database (ESVD) has been
              developed with the long-term goal of providing robust and easily
              accessible information on the economic benefits of ecosystems and
              biodiversity, and the costs of their loss, to support
              decision-making regarding nature conservation, ecosystem
              restoration, and sustainable land management. <br /><br />

              The focus of the ESVD is to gather information on economic welfare
              values related to ecosystem services measured in monetary units.
              By communicating such values in monetary units, we provide
              recognizable information that can be used to internalize the
              importance of Nature in decision making.

              Nizam, the first principal of Anandalok, who passed away suddenly.
              Mr. Nizam was a revolutionary individual who believed in
              encouraging children to read books. In today's context, promoting
              and sustaining the habit of reading books in society, particularly
              among children, is essential. The library aims to commemorate Mr.
              Nizam's memory and instill the habit of reading books among
              children and adults in the Anandalok school community. The goal of
